<b>Welcome to Rails-Dynamic-DropDown</b><br>
This is full functionality dynamic drop-down with rails, using coffeescript and mongoid.

<b>Getting Started</b><br>
First of all you make sure that mongodb is installed. <br>

<b>Clone</b>

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise.git</pre>
Then install the bundle and run the application.
